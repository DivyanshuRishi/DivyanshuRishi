<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
<p>I‚Äôm Divyanshu Dwivedi, a dedicated Computer Science student at Lucknow University specializing in Artificial Intelligence. My primary interests lie in web development and machine learning, and I‚Äôm driven by a desire to apply these skills to real-world problems. My recent internship at YBI Foundation allowed me to apply machine learning models for data analysis, enhancing accuracy by 85%. This experience strengthened my technical abilities and deepened my commitment to integrating AI and development.

I am currently building projects that showcase my skills in the MERN stack and am focused on creating responsive, user-centric applications. My education in Computer Science has provided me with a strong foundation, and I continue to expand my skill set through courses and personal projects in data science, machine learning, and web development.

I'm skilled in Python, JavaScript, React, and MongoDB and am committed to working in dynamic, collaborative environments that encourage continuous learning. I am excited to connect with others who share a passion for technology and problem-solving!</p>
